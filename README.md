Mobile data tracking notebook for Peace Corps Volunteers in the field to record hard to remember details of activities that they will be required to report on later. 

##Basic Description

Peace Corps Volunteers are asked to report out on their activities 2-3 times a year. When they do report they are asked to be very specific on how many people, in which communities, on what dates, and even the ages of those they are working with. This level of detail is difficult to recall three months after an event.
