=============

Mobile data tracking notebook for Peace Corps Volunteers in the field to record hard to remember details of activities that they will be required to report on later. 

##Basic Description

Peace Corps Volunteers are asked to report out on their activities 2-3 times a year. When they do report they are asked to be very specific on how many people, in which communities, on what dates, and even the ages of those they are working with. This level of detail is difficult to recall three months after an event. This app is meant to help solve that problem. 

Peace Corps Volunteer Julia describes the problem in this [video.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoKqJicuoXw)

##Major Functionalities
  * Create project frameworks that specific data can be added to on ongoing basis
  * Set reminders to add data to reoccuring activities
  * View an organized list of all data
  * Export data to .csv in an email

###Definitions
**Project** *-General area of work. A typical Peace Corps Volunteer would have 2-4 projects they are working on. When creating a project, the volunteer would add information that would apply to all activites and events within the project.*

**Activity** *-Group of events within a project. A project would typically have 2-6 activities within it. Some are reoccuring and some are one-time activities. When creating an activity within a project, the volunteer would add information that would apply to all events or occurances of the activity.*

**Event** *-Occurance of an activity. An Activity might have only one event associated with it or many depending on how often the activity takes place. When creating an event within an activity, the volunteer would add basic data about how many people were involved and who they were.*
